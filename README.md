The Zomato dataset helps us figure out what makes restaurants in Bengaluru popular. With over 12,000 places serving food, it's a competitive scene, especially for new ones. Since Bengaluru is the IT hub, people often rely on eating out due to lack of time to cook. The dataset analysis lets us dive into each area's preferencesâ€”like which types of food are a hit and if people there mostly prefer vegetarian options. We also explore if certain communities, like Jains or Gujaratis, who usually like veg food, are influencing these choices. This helps restaurants, whether new or old, understand the local taste buds and cater better to the diverse folks in Bengaluru.
